  ## Description
  This MERN application is blog for user's to document their journey to mastery of a new skill or as they try and achieve a goal. User's will be not only be able to track their own progress but will be able to comment on and encourage other users. As someone who is always working at honing my skills I wanted to create a place to document what I have been working on and the progress I have made for a variety of hobbies and interests. I also wanted to be able to gether opinions from others so that I can gain new knowledge and encourage other users on their journey. This application is a refactored version of a previous blog I created found at https://github.com/cverges1/Tech-Blog-MVC and another back-end I created found at https://github.com/cverges1/Social-Network-API and uses a React.js front-end.
